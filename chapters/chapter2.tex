\subsection{Vectorized convolution by Im2col and col2im}
The convolution operation can be implemented by many loops because the kernel will travel over the image. In terms of complexity, this is the easiest way to program but regard to timing, this idea is not efficient since it can only perform a convolution calculation sequentially. Now, with the highly support of hardward (explicitly GPU) that allows us to accelerate even more with parallel computation. In this part, we would like to break down 2 approaches in order to analyse their advantages and downsides.\par

In Im2col, we will trade off some memory for faster computation by trasforming the 3 -channels image to a matrix form in which the convolution operation can be performed more efficiently. We list out 3 stages to implement the efficient way to do vectorized convlution:
\begin{enumerate}
    \item Im2Col for input image and reshape the kernel: transform image and kernel to column form
    \item Do the matrix multiplication between Im2Col output and reshaped kernel
    \item Reshape the output of matrix multiplication to the form of convolution output.
\end{enumerate}
In particular, for step 1, the intensity values of images are within the sliding window will be flatten to a column, then the matrix will consist of many transformed columns like this, covering all the sliding position of the kernel scans through the images, check out figure~\ref{fig:im2col}. Moreover, in the case the image is colored (presumably 3 channels RGB), the output is the concatenated matrix by Im2col output with respect to 3 channels. Obviously, in order to make matrix multiplication feasible, the kernel need to be reshaped to row vector form as well (refer figure~\ref{fig:reshaped_kernels},\ref{fig:reshaped_kernels_3_channels}).\par

Then the $2^{nd}$ step is to do matrix multiplication between Im2Col output and reshaped kernels. Thus the result of 3-channels vectors multiply with 3-channels reshaped kernels rows is a single numeric value (figure~\ref{fig:matrix_multiplication}). Once the we found the matrix output of step 2, we need to convert this matrix into the form of convolution operation's result. For example, regardless padding option and set stride as 1, the image size $7\times7\times 3$ convolves with $3\times 3 \times N$ kernels will produce $5\times 5 \times N$ matrix (note: the number N is usually refered to the number of filter/the depth of feature map respectively for kernel/feature map case). So the output of matrix multiplication for vectorized convolution has the size $5\times(5*N)$ will be reshaped back to form $5\times 5 \times N$ (figure~\ref{fig:matrix_multiplication})
